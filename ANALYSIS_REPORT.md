## ü§ñ AI System Analysis

### Current Implementation (Groq-based)
**Strengths:**
- Fast response times
- Good integration with inventory context
- Comprehensive fallback system
- Professional responses

**Performance Score: 8/10**

### RAG System Consideration
**Recommendation: KEEP CURRENT SYSTEM**
